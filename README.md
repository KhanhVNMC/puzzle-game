## Project Overview  
This project offers a modern take on competitive Tetris (VS mode), enriched with dynamic Player vs Environment (PvE) elements. Departing from traditional Tetris formats, it introduces interactive enemy mechanics alongside contemporary gameplay features such as the Super Rotation System (SRS), Auto-Repeat Rate (ARR), Delayed Auto Shift (DAS), Hold system, Seven-Bag Generator and more. These enhancements create a more engaging and fun experience for players (not so sure about this)

## How To Run
You may either download the **precompiled executable** along with necessary game assets from the GitHub Releases tab or build the project manually using CMake (Not possible with this version)
